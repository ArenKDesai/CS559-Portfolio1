# THE NON-LINEAR BOOK OF FANTASY

I want this to have one page per checkbox with a character that stays in place when the page changes. 
He'll have to move between the pages to complete the story, which includes:
1. Grabbing a wand
2. Using the want to eliminate creatures
3. Navigating through platforms
Some pages will have toggles that only exist on those pages, and those toggles will be necesssary for progressing.
