# THE BOOK OF JOE

I want this to have one page per checkbox with a character that stays in place when the page changes. 
He'll have to move between the pages to complete the story, which includes:
1. Grabbing a wand
2. Using the want to eliminate creatures
3. Navigating through platforms
4. Page turning
Some pages will have toggles that only exist on those pages, and those toggles will be necesssary for progressing. 

## Pages
I need 12 in total - one per checkbox, besides the initial checkbox. 
The first number is the position of the page. The second number is the actual chapter number (out of order on purpose). 
1. (2) Table of Contents. Allows for switching between pages with links. 
2. (5, 6) Couple of enemies moving. Enemies block math wand. 
3. (7, 8, 11, 12, 13) Ouroboros with a path that can be changed with snake wand. 
4. Wand modifying station. Need to use to modify missle wand to not suck. 
5. Chest that requires Ouroboros to make a full circle. Reach chest through 4. 
6. (9) Basic puzzle with translations and rotations. Unlocks snake food. Requires math wand. 
7. (3, 4) Fishing wand and pond. Unlocks magic missle wand. Reach through 7. 
8. Platforms to reach 6.
